This project contains various C# libraries and executables that can be used to get a Lynxmotion robotic arm to play Tic-Tac-Toe against a human player using a simple Web cam to track the Tic-Tac-Toe board. Included are libraries for robot calibration, forward and inverse kinematics and communication with the SSC-32 servo controller. The vision system is built upon the Emgu CV .Net wrapper for the OpenCV image processing library.
